### Project Overview
The candy company wants to optimize its sales performance, production efficiency, and market reach. By analyzing sales data, factory locations, and regional targets, the company aims to identify trends, assess performance against targets, and uncover opportunities for growth and operational improvements.

### Data Sources
US Candy Distributor: The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the "US_Candy_Distributor.csv" file, containing Sales and geospatial factory to customer shipment data for a US national candy distributor, inlcuding information around customer & factory locations, sales orders & goals, and product details.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Power BI - Analysis and Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
  In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following task;
  1. Data loading and inspection,
  2. Handling missing values,
  3. Data Cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Candy Sales Data to answer key questions such as
- Which divisions and products generate the highest sales and profit?
- Which factories contribute the most to sales?
- Which states or cities have the highest demand for our candy products?
- Which products have the highest cost-to-profit ratio?

## Data Analysis
### Result/Findings
Include some intresting features worked with
- After performing a detailed analysis of the Cost-to-Profit Ratio for all products in the data-set, Kazookies was identified as the product with the highest Cost-to-Profit Ratio.
- The customer retention rate stands at 49.5%, indicating a stable level of customer loyalty.
- Kazookies is significantly above the average of the other products, meaning that its production cost is disproportionate to the profit it generates. This finding suggests that the company is facing a sub-optimal profit margin for this product.
- States in the United States like California and Texas have the highest the demand and consumption rates of our goods.

### Recommendations 
Based on this finding, the following steps are recommended for further evaluation and potential corrective measures:
1. Cost Reduction Initiatives: A detailed review of the production costs for Kazookies should be conducted to identify potential areas for cost reduction, such as optimizing supply chains, renegotiating with suppliers, or improving manufacturing efficiency.
2. Pricing Strategy Review: A reassessment of the pricing strategy for Kazookies could help improve its profitability. Increasing the product price (if feasible within market constraints) could help boost the gross profit margin, thereby lowering the Cost-to-Profit Ratio.
3. Sales and Marketing Efforts: Increasing the sales volume of Kazookies would help improve the overall gross profit and make the product more profitable. Enhancing marketing efforts to increase customer awareness or expanding the product's market reach might contribute to better sales performance.
4. Profitability Analysis: Further analysis of other key financial metrics, such as break-even point, contribution margin, and net profit margin, should be conducted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Kazookies' financial performance.

## Customer Retention: Key Findings & Recommendations
1. Targeted Retention Strategies: Focus on personalized offers and loyalty programs to increase customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
2. Customer Feedback: Implement surveys or feedback loops to better understand customer needs and improve their experience.
3. Marketing Campaigns: Launch campaigns aimed at re-engaging customers who have not made recent purchases, with special promotions or tailored incentives.

By focusing on these strategies, the company can gradually improve retention, ensuring long-term customer loyalty and higher lifetime value.

### Limitations
I had to remove certain columns like the Shipping dates due to inaccuracy in the dates.
